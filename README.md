# vocabulary_tainer

This is a simple command-line tool for learning words in a foreign language.

## Requirements
[Python >= 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Instructions

- Add the words that you are willing to learn to the `words.json` file like so:

``` json
"word in your primary language": "translation to the language you are learning"
```

- Run the `vocabulary.py` with `Python 3.x` and type the translations. 

- The words will be shuffled and you will be asked to enter translations one after another.

- To quit type `quit()`, otherwise the program will quit automatically when you entered all words.

- In the end, you will be presented with your score and a summary of the words that you got wrong.
